# üõ∞Ô∏è Restaumatic Webhook API
This API is provided to enable other services to receive real-time information about new orders placed through Restaumatic system. The intended use cases include, but are not limited to integration with point of sale systems and delivery tracking.

# Development infrastructure

Please contact us to get access to development infrastracture (test restaurant with your development endpoint).

# Enabling integration

Integration has to be configured and enabled for given restaurant by Restaumatic support. In the future, we may add this option to restaurant‚Äôs panel to allow self-service.

API may be used in two modes: push, where configured webhook is called on order status change, or poll, when client periodically checks for incoming order. For push mode we need webhook URL in order to enable integration. Upon enabling integration one should receive an API Key that is required to perform API calls as well as authenticate webhook calls. This should be provided as a query parameter `apiKey` when calling Restaumatic endpoints as indicated in the documentation.

# Receiving orders

In order for Restaumatic to send webhook payloads, your server needs to be accessible from the Internet. We also highly suggest using SSL so that we can send encrypted payloads over HTTPS. The order data will be sent to configured URLs as a POST request with `application/json` payload. API key will be provided as a `apiKey` query parameter. Restaumatic expects `200 OK` response. In case of failure, Restaumatic will retry calling a webhook.

The webhook will be triggered when:

- new order is placed and it needs to be confirmed,
- an order was accepted,
- an order was cancelled.

Order may be accepted or cancelled with other channel and the webhook client should take this into account.

**Note:** Restaumatic automatically cancels orders that are not confirmed within a specified period (approximately 15 minutes, is subject to change). In such case, the customer is notified about this and is refunded (if paid online). Likely, an external system should reflect this state change.


## Data format

**General notes**

- All timestamps in UTC (ISO8601 format).
- Fields marked as nullable may be not present in JSON objects.
- Not nullable fields are in **bold**.
- We may add more fields in the future. We will do our best to maintain backward compatibility.
- `productId` is unique for each specific variant (size) of a menu item.
- In case of online payment we call webhooks after payment was successfully processed.

**Half and half pizzas**

Half and half pizzas are encoded as ordinary items. However, they use fixed UUID for `productId` and `variant.id`. The latter may be used to obtain information on pizza size. The information about parts, i.e. base pizza name, product and variant ids and topping adjustments are encoded in `extra.parts` attribute of an item in similar fashion to regular pizzas. Half and half pizzas may be also disabled by the restaurant in the admin panel.

Split pizza product UUID: `bb696623-ac72-5850-81bf-759b54e23b27`
Variant id by Restaumatic size in Restaumatic system:
1. `3909adee-2fd3-5af8-bd5f-03e33ed48b7d`

# Accepting & rejecting orders

The confirmation data shall be sent to callback URL provided in webhook data as a POST request with `application/json` payload. Currently we use the following endpoints:

Testing: `https://www.manca.ro/api/v1/integrations/orders/ORDER_ID?apiKey=API_KEY`

Production: `https://www.skubacz.pl/api/v1/integrations/orders/ORDER_ID?apiKey=API_KEY`

Order id has to be provided both in URL as well as in request body.

**Accept the order**

    {
      "orderId": "0241c2a3-ee54-4c43-bad0-89a2e446e2b4",
      "status": "Accepted",
      "deliveryTime": "2018-10-03T23:16:04.022526Z"
    }

**Reject the order**

    {
      "orderId": "0241c2a3-ee54-4c43-bad0-89a2e446e2b4",
      "status": "Rejected",
      "comment": "We've run out of pizza dough."
    }


# Debugging webhooks

We provide special endpoint for webhook debugging. It will present some diagnostic information about recent webhook calls. Note, as this is debugging API we may change and improve this from time to time without notice.

Testing: `https://www.manca.ro/api/v1/integrations/log?apiKey=API_KEY`

Production: `https://www.skubacz.pl/api/v1/integrations/log?apiKey=API_KEY`


# Retrieving recent orders (polling)

If using webhooks is not suitable for your use case, we make polling endpoint available. It will return recent orders, including confirmed or rejected ones. Remember, orders may be automatically cancelled by Restaumatic.

Testing: `https://www.manca.ro/api/v1/integrations/orders?apiKey=API_KEY`

Production: `https://www.skubacz.pl/api/v1/integrations/orders?apiKey=API_KEY`

# Getting product list

In some cases one may require to map products from Restaumatic to products in the external system. To make this possible we provide an extra endpoint to retrieve full list of products including available variants. Then the mapping procedure has to be implemented in the external system.

| **Field**     | **Type**                |                                                                                            |
